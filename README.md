# (Unofficial) Andes Community Group Meeting 2025

This repository aims to facilitate the planning and coordination of a second Andes Workshop Meeting, similar to what we did back in 2022 to deal with species issues ([see this branch](https://github.com/dfo-gulf-science/Andes-National-Working-Group-Meetings/tree/2022)). This time, the proposed workshop aims to resolve recurring issues encountered when integrating Andes data into existing data repositories. This workshop also coincides with the publication of a Technical Report on Andes and the release of Andes Version 3. This would also be a good forum to discuss Andes governance.

The last workshop was held in Moncton, NB and most participants were present in-person. Ideally we would also hold this second workshop in-person.

## Background

Another data entry system (Andes) is a web-based computer application that supports data entry during field activities such as scientific ecosystem surveys and port sampling. The application was initially developed by DFO Gulf Region and has been used during the annual southern Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem survey since 2020. More information about the application can be found in a [DFO technical report](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.939271/publication.html) published in 2024 and available from the DFO library. 

## Proposed Format, Date and Location

Hybrid **2-day workshop** consisting of presentations from participants and discussions on data integration.

**Physical attendance is highly preferred** however a virtual option will remain available.   

Potential location will be at the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC) in Moncton, but will depend on travel constraint and considerations from the different regions (i.e., who gets approval and has travel funds available).

**Tentative dates are TBD.** 


## Objectives

- Close the loop on 2022 Species Lists discussion
  - Regionalisation followed by de-regionalization
  - Birth of CARL
- Understand regional post-processing workflows:
  - What physical infrastructure and software are used (e.g., LXC/LXD, k8s, cruises app, glf-proxy)? 
  - What do regions use old Andes instances for?
  - Where does Ecosystem Survey data (including images) go? (into Oracle mostly)
  - Where does Oceanographic data go (DART, BioChem, IML Workflow)?
  - What happens to all other data (e.g., ScanMar, sampling protocols, species / catch information)?
- Establish a tenable and coherent strategy for reporting in Andes;
  - Ensuring stability for all end users (e.g., unit testing)
  - Decide on a single format for an official Andes Ecosystem Survey Report
  - Opportunities for development of downstream infrastructure for accessing data (e.g., R packages, Python packages, scripts from Andes to Oracle, etc.)   
- Initiate discussions regarding Andes governance. Is there a need for an Andes National Steering Committee?
